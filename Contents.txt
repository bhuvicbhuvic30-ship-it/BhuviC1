#INTRODUCTION
Heart disease (cardiovascular disease) is the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for ~17.9 million deaths annually (about 32% of all deaths).
Types: Coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, etc.
Risk factors: High blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, age, gender.
Early detection can reduce mortality by up to 80% through timely interventions.
Challenge: Traditional diagnosis (e.g., ECG, blood tests) is time-consuming and costly.
